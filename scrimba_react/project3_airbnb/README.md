In this project, I learned how to...
- create separate (reusable) components for each part of a page
- use Array.prototype.map to return a new collection of components with attributes set on each component based on the properties of the iterating object
- dynamically propagate HTML elements with the props argument
- use conditional rendering on a page (for example - {!props.openSpots && <div className="card--badge">SOLD OUT</div>})
- how to use the ES6 spread syntax to pass in an entire object to props

This was a great first project! Excited to learn more and start making API calls instead of using data from a js file.
